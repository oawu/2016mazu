monaco.ttf
==========

The original monaco.ttf improved: add some special characters (which are from "DejaVu Sans Mono")

In my work environment, I need connect to Linux system from Windows system remotely using SecureCRT or Putty, and edit files using VIM tools. So I need one beautiful font in SecureCRT / Putty.

In windows system, there are some original fonts are beautiful, for example "Consolas", but they can't support some special characters, for example: ▸, ↪, ⌴. Because they are original fonts in my Windows, I don't want to modify them.

I get "Monaco" from web. It is tiny and beautiful. But it also can't support those special characters.

So I add the characters by myself and share it.
